## What is this project about

The project allow you to detect a face when you insert an image from an url input. You can do it only once you register/login with your account! Everytime you detect a face, your entries count will update so you will know how many times you input image to detect.

## My agile workflow 

I created a project to manage my workflow inside the git repository. I divided my tasks into three sessions:

* in progress: I move the todos here when I am working on that
* done: I move the tasks here when I finished it
